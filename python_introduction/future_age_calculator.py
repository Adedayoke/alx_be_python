# Future Age Calculator
# This program calculates how old a user will be in the year 2050

# Prompt user for their current age
current_age = int(input("How old are you? "))

# Calculate age in 2050 (assuming current year is 2023, so add 27 years)
future_age = current_age + 27

# Print the result in the required format
print(f"In 2050, you will be {future_age} years old.")
